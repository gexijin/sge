After being shown by my students many times, I finally figured out how to use Docker to define an isolated environment. My problem is that I wanted to run the most recent version of R and Bioconductor without bothering you guys. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


Turns out it is a two-liner:
{r eval=FALSE}
sudo docker login -u gexijin
sudo docker run --name=my-r-base --rm -ti -v /home/gex/Rdocker:/myData
```
 bioconductor/release_core2  /bin/bash

The first line we need to log-in using username and password from Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/
The 2nd line, downloads the most recent Bioconductor image from Docker hub, and runs it. A local folder is mapped to the container. 


Itâ€™s quite useful to have an environment that you can mess with. 


If you want to customize the docker image with additional R packages and use it more than once. Here is the complete steps:
# 1.	Docker login
sudo docker login - u gexijin
 
# 2.	Save this  as a file called: Dockerfile 

 
FROM bioconductor/release_core2
# https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/
 
# install Bioconductor packages
RUN R -e 'source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"); biocLite(c("GO.db", "GOstats"), suppressUpdates = T)'
 
 
3.	Create image called bioconductor
sudo docker build -t bioconductor .
 
4.	Run an instance (mapping Rdocker folder in the host to /myData in the container)
docker run -v /home/gex/Rdocker:/myData --name bioconductor1 -t bioconductor
 
From <https://deis.com/blog/2015/creating-sharing-first-docker-image/> 
 
5.	Access docker instance
sudo docker exec -it bioconductor1 /bin/bash
 
6.	Run large R script 
nohup R CMD BATCH gene_mapping_all.R > nohup.out &
 
7.	Stop a docker instance
sudo docker stop bioconductor1
