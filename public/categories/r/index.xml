      <description>Update. 11/13/17 Thanks to Mike Love for pointing out an error. This is just my understanding. There maybe other errors.
To allow complex study designs in iDEP(http://ge-lab.org/idep/), I tried to understand how factoral models are built and the desired results are extracted from DESeq2. The following is based on the help document from the resutls( ) function in DESeq2, plus some of Mike Love&amp;rsquo;s answers to questions from users.</description>

      <description>Using the mass shooting data from Mother Jones website, I tried to forecast the number of mass shoottings and total fatalities in the rest of 2018. Some of the R scripts are from this website. Please let me know if I there is any error. I am not an expert on time series analysis. Twitter @StevenXGe
In recent years, mass shootings are becomming more frequent and more deadly. The models suggest for the rest of 2018, there probably be about 6 more shootings, killing about 59 people in the U.</description>
