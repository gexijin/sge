      <description>Spot instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows researchers to do high performance computing at very low cost. These are spare computing capacities that could be abruptly terminated. But such interruptions are rare, and can be tolerated in scientific research. For example, a 64-core workstation with 256 GB of memory can be rented at about $0.7 per hour, which is ~80% off regular on-demand prices. You can request 10 of such servers and use them for 5 days and 2 hours and it only cost you a few hundred dollars.</description>
