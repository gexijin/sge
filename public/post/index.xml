      <title>Using Amazon EC2 to run large data analyses cheaply</title>

      <description>Spot instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows researchers to do high performance computing at very low cost. These are spare computing capacities that could be abruptly terminated. But such interruptions are rare, and can be tolerated in scientific research. For example, a 64-core workstation with 256 GB of memory can be rented at about $0.7 per hour, which is ~80% off regular on-demand prices. You can request 10 of such servers and use them for 5 days and 2 hours and it only cost you a few hundred dollars.</description>

      <description>Update. 11/13/17 Thanks to Mike Love for pointing out an error. This is just my understanding. There maybe other errors.
To allow complex study designs in iDEP(http://ge-lab.org/idep/), I tried to understand how factoral models are built and the desired results are extracted from DESeq2. The following is based on the help document from the resutls( ) function in DESeq2, plus some of Mike Love&amp;rsquo;s answers to questions from users.</description>

      <title>First experience with Docker</title>

      <description>With the help of my students, I finally figured out how to use Docker to define an isolated environment. I wanted to run the most recent version of R and Bioconductor in a Linux machine without bothering IT support people.
Turns out it is a one-liner, if you have the docker software installed:
sudo docker run --name=my-r-base --rm -ti -v /home/gex/Rdocker:/myData bioconductor/release_core2 /bin/bash  It downloads the most recent Bioconductor image from Docker hub, and runs it.</description>

      <description>Using the mass shooting data from Mother Jones website, I tried to forecast the number of mass shoottings and total fatalities in the rest of 2018. Some of the R scripts are from this website. Please let me know if I there is any error. I am not an expert on time series analysis. Twitter @StevenXGe
In recent years, mass shootings are becomming more frequent and more deadly. The models suggest for the rest of 2018, there probably be about 6 more shootings, killing about 59 people in the U.</description>
